# Use

Apply a variety of filters to your image. For example:
* Greyscale. `greyscale image`
* Remove some color channels. (eg get rid of all the red in the image, to make it look aqua!) `image with some of the colors`
* Simple greenscreening functionality. (only works with white) `image with white being transparent`
* Innovative principle where you have dynamic transparency in the image, proportional to how white each individual pixel is. `image where the brightness of each part of the image determines its transparency`

Make the image fun!
* Disco mode! Who doesn't like strobe lights and a changing background! (Hint: Use it with a setting that changes transparency for a fun time) `disco mode`
